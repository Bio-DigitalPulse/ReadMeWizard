# ReadMeWizard

This application is an automatically generated README file for any project, with varying specifications and fully customizable. This project increases workspace productibility by reducing the time required to produce this file in a typical environment. 

Using Node.js, we dynamically generate questions asking specific job related questions to ensure the transporation of the vital information needed to continue the project progression. comments included throughout will give clarification, giving descriptions of code function used. Effecient code being a neccessity, multiple functions condensed keeps the accessibility open to junior and senior developers alike, while simultaneously satisfying the following requirements:
